#Restore GRUB

To put you a bit in context, I decided to give my old MacBook Pro Late 2011 a new life by installing Ubuntu netively in one of the 2 hard drives. Almost 1 yesr after buying my MacBook, I decided to exchange the internal DVD drive for a second HDD. In that slot, years later I switched from HDD so SSD.
Other upgrades I made on my old MacBook Pro was upgrade from 4 Gb of RAM to 16Gb, change the fan (was too noisy after 12 years running), changed the speakers and the thermal paste. And after all this years it's still running like the first day, with this new operative system installed. The reason I decided to keep this MacBook Pro, was due to the Intel Chip, thanks to it I'm still able to create home labs in VirtualBox or learning Netwokring using GNS3, or installing older Windows versions to practice pentesting, things that today still does not work as smooth as it should on Mac with Apple Chips.
